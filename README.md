Optimal Stopping for research/investment (WIP)

Overview:
Given a finite amount of time, a range of possible decisions (investments), and an option to perform research(see detailed explanation below), there exists a common dilemma: 

When should research stop and a decision be selected? These problems are tackled with the theory of "Optimal Stopping", where we try to find a solution to choosing a "a time to take a particular action, in order to maximise an expected reward or minimise an expected cost".

For this particular case, we work with the logic that, in principle, instances of research may be used upon a selection of options(ranging from worst to best value) to increase the average expected value of a final selection. Simply put, research-driven decisions should yield better results.

But how much does research do? How many resources should we put into research to optimize our results? Thus, the goal of this project to refine optimal stoppage in research.
